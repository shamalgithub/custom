            <p>
              With a special emphasis on the effects of crossover
               and mutation rates, this study applies genetic 
               algorithms to optimize the costs of microgrids.
                As a way to incorporate renewable energy sources
                 into isolated and underserved locations, 
                 microgrids are becoming more and more popular.
                  They may lose some of their benefits over 
                  conventional power generation systems if not
                   configured properly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of this study is
                    to pinpoint the ideal operational conditions for
                     using genetic algorithms to optimise microgrid costs.
                      The study focuses on the Sri Lankan energy market
                       with the goal of promoting decentralized 
                       Microgrid technologies and boosting the 
                       dependability of the energy service sector.
                       The method uses a genetic algorithm written 
                       in Python and runs through 100 generations
                        to find the best operating settings. 
                        The operational expenses of each unit,
                         the cost of carbon dioxide emissions,
                          and the present value of future running
                           costs are all taken into account in 
                           the cost optimization equation for 
                           the microgrid.
            </p>
            <p>
              To determine how 
                           crossover and mutation rates affect 
                           fitness, several experiments were run. 
                           For statistical analysis, the Kruskal-Wallis
                            H-test was utilized, and a 
                            Dunn post hoc test was used to find significant
                             pairwise differences in mutation rates.
                              The results show that the performance 
                              of the genetic algorithm for Microgrid 
                              cost optimization is not significantly 
                              affected by crossover rates. However,
                               convergence and algorithm speed may be
                                impacted by abnormally low or high 
                                crossover rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, 
              fitness is significantly impacted by 
              mutation rates, with higher mutation 
              rates typically producing better outcomes.
               However, due to potential anomalies 
               in algorithm output, extreme mutation 
               rates should be used with caution.
                The ideal mutation rate range, 
                which balances genetic diversity and
                 convergence, was discovered to be
                  between 1% and 10%. In summary,
                   this study offers insightful 
                   information about the use of genetic
                    algorithms for Microgrid cost
                     optimization. Performance is not 
                     much impacted by crossover rates,
                      however attaining the best results 
                      depends on mutation rates. 
                      The 1% to 10% recommended 
                      mutation rate range provides 
                      algorithm convergence and consistent
                       outcomes. These discoveries 
                       will help professionals in the
                        energy sector who are working
                         to promote and deploy Microgrid 
                         systems in Sri Lanka and other
                          areas, giving them the 
                          ability to construct power 
                          generation strategies 
                          efficiently and make the
                           most of renewable energy 
                           sources.
